This guide assumes that you've followed [the previous walkthrough][agentprep], and have a fresh agent VM that can reach your original master VM over the network. Both VMs should be running right now, and you'll need to be logged in to both of them as root.


Introduction
-----

### How Do Agents Get Configurations?

Puppet's agent/master mode is **pull-based.** Usually, agents are configured to periodically fetch a catalog and apply it, and the master controls what goes into that catalog. (For the next few exercises, though, you'll be triggering runs manually.)

### What Do Agents Do, and What Do Masters Do?

[Earlier](./manifests.html#aside-compilation), you saw this diagram of how Puppet compiles and applies a manifest:

![Diagram of manifests being compiled into a catalog, which gets applied to enforce a defined system state.][unified]

Running Puppet in agent/master mode works much the same way --- the main difference is that it moves the manifests and compilation to the puppet master server. Agents don't have to see any manifest files at all, and have no access to configuration information that isn't in their own catalog.

The Agent Subcommand
-----

The puppet agent subcommand fetches configurations from a master server. It has two main modes:

1. Daemonize and fetch configurations every half-hour (default)
2. Run once and quit

We'll be using the second mode, since it gives a better view of what's going on. To keep the agent from daemonizing, you should use the `--test` option, which also prints detailed descriptions of what the agent is doing.

If you accidentally run the agent without `--test`, it will daemonize and run in the background. To check whether the agent is running in the background, run:

    # /etc/init.d/pe-puppet status

To turn it off, run:

    # /etc/init.d/pe-puppet stop

Saying Hi
-----

Time to start! **On your agent VM,** start puppet agent for the first time:

    [root@agent1 ~]# puppet agent --test
    info: Creating a new SSL key for agent1.localdomain
    warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session
    info: Caching certificate for ca
    warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session
    warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session
    info: Creating a new SSL certificate request for agent1.localdomain
    info: Certificate Request fingerprint (md5): FD:E7:41:C9:2C:B7:5C:27:11:0C:8F:9C:1D:F6:F9:46
    warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session
    warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session
    warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session
    Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled

Hmm.

### What Happened?

Puppet agent found the puppet master, but it got stopped at the certificate roadblock. It isn't authorized to fetch configurations, so the master is turning it away.

### Troubleshooting

It's possible you didn't see the response printed above, and there are a number of possible culprits. Read back over the [instructions for creating your agent VM](./agentprep.html) and make sure you didn't miss anything; in particular, check that:

* The VMs can ping each other
* The agent can resolve the puppet master by host name
* The agent's `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf` file has a `server` setting (in the `[agent]` block) of `puppet` or `learn.localdomain`
* The VMs' clocks are in sync

Signing the Certificate
-----

So we'll authorize it! **On your puppet master VM,** check the list of outstanding certificate requests with `puppet cert list`. (More about this command later.)

    [root@learn ~]# puppet cert list
      agent1.localdomain (FD:E7:41:C9:2C:B7:5C:27:11:0C:8F:9C:1D:F6:F9:46)

_There's_ our agent node. And the request fingerprint matches, too. You know this node is okay, so go ahead and sign its certificate with `puppet cert sign`:

    [root@learn ~]# puppet cert sign agent1.localdomain
    notice: Signed certificate request for agent1.localdomain
    notice: Removing file Puppet::SSL::CertificateRequest agent1.localdomain at '/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/requests/agent1.localdomain.pem'

Now that it's authorized, **go back to the agent VM** and run puppet agent again:

    [root@agent1 ~]# puppet agent --test
    warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session
    info: Caching certificate for agent1.localdomain
    info: Retrieving plugin
    info: Caching certificate_revocation_list for ca
    info: Loading facts in facter_dot_d
    info: Loading facts in facter_dot_d
    info: Loading facts in facter_dot_d
    info: Loading facts in facter_dot_d
    info: Caching catalog for agent1.localdomain
    info: Applying configuration version '1326210629'
    notice: Finished catalog run in 0.11 seconds

It worked! That was a successful Puppet run, although it didn't do much yet.

### What Happened?

Puppet uses SSL certificates to protect communications between agents and the master. Since agents can't do a full run without a certificate, our agent had to ask for one and then wait for the request to get approved.

We'll cover SSL in more detail later.

Serving a Real Configuration
-----

So how can we make the agent do something interesting? Well, we already built some useful classes, and they're all available on the puppet master, so we'll use them. (If you haven't already copied the modules from your old VM into your puppet master's `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules` directory, do so now.)

But how do we choose which classes go into an agent's catalog?

### Site.pp

When we were using puppet apply, we would usually specify a manifest file, which declared all of the classes or resources we wanted to apply.

The puppet master works the same way, except that it **always loads the same manifest file,** which we usually refer to as site.pp. With Puppet Enterprise, it's located by default at `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp`, but you can configure its location with [the `manifest` setting](/references/latest/configuration.html#manifest).

You could declare classes and resources directly in site.pp, but that would make every node get the same resources in its catalog, which is of limited use. Instead, we'll hide the classes we want to declare in a **node definition.**

### Node Definitions

Node definitions work almost exactly like class definitions:

{% highlight ruby %}
    # Append this at the bottom of /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp

    node 'agent1.localdomain' {

      # Note the quotes around the name! Node names can have characters that
      # aren't legal for class names, so you can't always use bare, unquoted
      # strings like we do with classes.

      # Any resource or class declaration can go inside here. For now:

      include apache

      class {'ntp':
        servers => [ "ntp1.example.com dynamic", "ntp2.example.com dynamic", ],
      }

    }
{% endhighlight %}

But unlike classes, nodes are declared automatically, based on the **name** of the node whose catalog is being compiled. **Only one** node definition will get added to a given catalog, and any other node definitions are effectively hidden.

An agent node's **name** is almost always read from its [`certname` setting](/references/latest/configuration.html#certname), which is set at install time but can be changed later. The certname is usually (but not always) the node's fully qualified domain name.

More on node definitions later, as well as alternate ways to assign classes to a node.

### Pulling the New Configuration

Now that you've saved site.pp with a node definition that matches the agent VM's name, go back to that VM and run puppet agent again:

    [root@agent1 ~]# puppet agent --test
    info: Retrieving plugin
    info: Loading facts in facter_dot_d
    info: Loading facts in facter_dot_d

Success! We've pulled a configuration that actually does something.

If you change this node's definition in site.pp, it will fetch that new configuration on its next run (which, in a normal environment, would happen less than 30 minutes after you make the change).

More Installments Coming Later
----

You now know how to:

* Run puppet agent interactively with `--test`
* Authorize a new agent node to pull configurations from the puppet master
* Use node definitions in site.pp to choose which classes go into a given node's catalog

But there are some important details we've glossed over. In a future installment, we'll talk more about certificates and node classification.
