title: "Learning Puppet â€” Defined Types"
---


Beyond Singletons
-----

Say you wrote a chunk of Puppet code that takes parameters and configures an individual Apache virtual host. You put it in a class. It works fine, but since classes are singletons, Puppet won't ever let you declare more than one vhost.

What you want is something more like a _resource type_ --- you can't declare the same resource twice, but you can declare as many files or users as you want.

{% highlight ruby %}
    apache::vhost {'users.example.com':
      port    => 80,
      docroot => '/var/www/personal',
      options => 'Indexes MultiViews',
    }
{% endhighlight %}

This turns out to be easy. To model _repeatable_ chunks of configuration --- like a Git repository or an Apache vhost --- you should use **defined resource types.**

Defined types act like normal resource types and are declared in the same way, but they're composed of other resources.

Defining a Type
-----

**You define a type with the `define` keyword,** and the definition looks almost exactly like a class with parameters. You need:

- The `define` keyword
- A **name**
- A list of **parameters** (in parentheses, after the name)
    - Defined types always automatically get a special `$title` parameter. Its value is always set to the title of the resource instance. (The `$name` parameter acts the same way --- you can treat it as a synonym for `$title`.)

        Classes get `$title` and `$name` parameters too, but they're less useful since a class only has one name.
- A **block of Puppet code**

Like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
    define planfile ($user = $title, $content) {
      file {"/home/${user}/.plan":
        ensure  => file,
        content => $content,
        mode    => 0644,
        owner   => $user,
        require => User[$user],
      }
    }

    user {'nick':
      ensure     => present,
      managehome => true,
      uid        => 517,
    }
    planfile {'nick':
      content => "Working on new Learning Puppet chapters. Tomorrow: upgrading the LP virtual machine.",
    }
{% endhighlight %}

This one's pretty simple. (In fact, it's basically just a macro.) It has two parameters, one of which is optional (it defaults to the title of the resource), and the collection of resources it declares is just a single file resource.

So it's pretty simple, right? Exactly like defining a class? **Almost:** there's one extra requirement. Since the user might declare any number of instances of a defined type, you have to make sure that the implementation will **never declare the same resource twice.**

Consider a slightly different version of that first definition:

{% highlight ruby %}
    define planfile ($user = $title, $content) {
      file {'.plan':
        path    => "/home/${user}/.plan",
        ensure  => file,
        content => $content,
        mode    => 0644,
        owner   => $user,
        require => User[$user],
      }
    }
{% endhighlight %}

See how the title of the file resource isn't tied to any of the definition's parameters?

{% highlight ruby %}
    planfile {'nick':
      content => "Working on new Learning Puppet chapters. Tomorrow: upgrading the LP virtual machine.",
    }

    planfile {'chris':
      content => "Resurrecting a very dead laptop.",
    }
{% endhighlight %}

    # puppet apply planfiles.pp
    Duplicate definition: File[.plan] is already defined in file /root/manifests/planfile.pp at line 9; cannot redefine at /root/manifests/planfile.pp:9 on node puppet.localdomain

Yikes. You can see where we went wrong --- every time we declare an instance of `planfile`, it's going to declare the resource `File['.plan']`, and Puppet will fail compilation if you try to declare the same resource twice.

![Tragedy vs. comedy - a diagram showing a resource being declared by two defined type instances, and a diagram showing unique resources being declared by each instance.][collision]

To avoid this, you have to make sure that **both the title and the name** (or namevar) of **every resource** in the definition are somehow derived from a **unique parameter** (often the `$title`) of the defined type. (For example, we couldn't derive the file's title from the `$content` of the `planfile` resource, because more than one user might write the same .plan text.)

If there's a singleton resource that has to exist for any instance of the defined type to work, you should:

* Put that resource in a class.
* Inside the type definition, use `include` to declare that class.
* Also inside the type definition, use something like the following to establish an order dependency:

        # Make sure compilation will fail if 'myclass' doesn't get declared:
        Class['myclass'] -> Apache::Vhost["$title"]

    Establishing ordering relationships at the class level is generally better than directly requiring one of the resources inside it.

Defined Types in Modules
-----

[autoloader]: ./modules1.html#module-structure

Defined types can be autoloaded just like classes, and thus used from anywhere in your manifests. [Like with classes][autoloader], **each defined type should go in its own file** in a module's `manifests/` directory, and **the same rules for namespacing apply.** (So the `apache::vhost` type would go somewhere like `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/apache/manifests/vhost.pp`, and if we were to keep the `planfile` type around, it would go in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/planfile/manifests/init.pp`.)

### Resource References and Namespaced Types

You might have already noticed this above, but: when you make a [resource reference](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_datatypes.html#resource-references) to an instance of a defined type, you have to **capitalize every [namespace segment](/puppet/latest/reference/lang_namespaces.html)** in the type's name. That means an instance of the `foo::bar::baz` type would be referenced like `Foo::Bar::Baz['mybaz']`.

An Example: Apache Vhosts
-----

Not that my .plan macro wasn't pretty great, but let's be serious for a minute. Remember your [Apache module](./modules1.html#exercises) from a few chapters back? Let's extend it so we can easily declare vhosts. This example code is borrowed from [the puppetlabs-apache module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache).

{% highlight ruby %}
    # Definition: apache::vhost
    #
    # This class installs Apache Virtual Hosts
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - The $port to configure the host on
    # - The $docroot provides the DocumentationRoot variable
    # - The $template option specifies whether to use the default template or override
    # - The $priority of the site
    # - The $serveraliases of the site
    # - The $options for the given vhost
    # - The $vhost_name for name based virtualhosting, defaulting to *
    #
    # Actions:
    # - Install Apache Virtual Hosts
    #
    # Requires:
    # - The apache class
    #
    # Sample Usage:
    #  apache::vhost { 'site.name.fqdn':
    #    priority => '20',
    #    port => '80',
    #    docroot => '/path/to/docroot',
    #  }
    #
    define apache::vhost(
        $port,
        $docroot,
        $template      = 'apache/vhost-default.conf.erb',
        $priority      = '25',
        $servername    = '',
        $serveraliases = '',
        $options       = "Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews",
        $vhost_name    = '*'
      ) {

      include apache

      # Below is a pre-2.6.5 idiom for having a parameter default to the title,
      # but you could also just declare $servername = "$title" in the parameters
      # list and change srvname to servername in the template.

      if $servername == '' {
        $srvname = $title
      } else {
        $srvname = $servername
      }
      case $operatingsystem {
        'centos', 'redhat', 'fedora': { $vdir   = '/etc/httpd/conf.d'
                                        $logdir = '/var/log/httpd'}
        'ubuntu', 'debian':           { $vdir   = '/etc/apache2/sites-enabled'
                                        $logdir = '/var/log/apache2'}
        default:                      { $vdir   = '/etc/apache2/sites-enabled'
                                        $logdir = '/var/log/apache2'}
      }
      file {
        "${vdir}/${priority}-${name}.conf":
          content => template($template),
          owner   => 'root',
          group   => 'root',
          mode    => '755',
          require => Package['httpd'],
          notify  => Service['httpd'],
      }

    }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight erb %}
    # /etc/puppetlabs/modules/apache/templates/vhost-default.conf.erb

    # ************************************
    # Default template in module puppetlabs-apache
    # Managed by Puppet
    # ************************************

    Listen <%= port %>
    NameVirtualHost <%= vhost_name %>:<%= port %>
    <VirtualHost <%= vhost_name %>:<%= port %>>
      ServerName <%= srvname %>
    <% if serveraliases.is_a? Array -%>
    <% serveraliases.each do |name| -%><%= "  ServerAlias #{name}\n" %><% end -%>
    <% elsif serveraliases != '' -%>
    <%= "  ServerAlias #{serveraliases}" -%>
    <% end -%>
      DocumentRoot <%= docroot %>
      <Directory <%= docroot %>>
        Options <%= options %>
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
      </Directory>
      ErrorLog <%= logdir %>/<%= name %>_error.log
      LogLevel warn
      CustomLog <%= logdir %>/<%= name %>_access.log combined
      ServerSignature Off
    </VirtualHost>
{% endhighlight %}

And that's more or less a wrap. You can apply a manifest like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
    apache::vhost {'testhost':
      port => 8081,
      docroot => '/var/www-testhost',
      priority => 25,
      servername => 'puppet',
    }
{% endhighlight %}

...and (as long as the directory exists) you'll immediately be able to reach the new vhost:

    # curl http://puppet:8081

In a way, this is just slightly more sophisticated than the first example --- it's still only one `file` resource --- but the use of a template makes it a LOT more powerful, and you can already see how much time it can save. And you can make it slicker as you build more types: once you've got a custom type that handles firewall rules, for example, you can add something like _this_ to the definition:

    firewall {"0100-INPUT ACCEPT $port":
        jump  => 'ACCEPT',
        dport => "$port",
        proto => 'tcp'
    }

Exercises
-----

Take a minute to make a few more defined types, just to get used to modeling repeatable groups of resources.

* Try wrapping a `user` resource in a `human::user` type that manages that person's .bashrc file and manages one or more `ssh_authorized_key` resources for their account.
* If you're familiar with git, take a stab at writing a `git::repo` type that can clone from a repository on the network (and maybe even keep the working copy up-to-date on a specific branch!). This'll be harder --- you'll probably have to make a `git` class to make sure git is available, and you'll have to use at least one `file` (`ensure => directory`) and at least one `exec` resource. Keep in mind that execs can be tricky, since you need to make sure they only run when necessary.

One Last Tip
-----

Defined types take input, and input can get a little dirty --- you might want to check your parameters to make sure they're the correct data type, and fail early if they're garbage instead of writing undefined stuff to the system.

If you're going to make a practice of validating your inputs (hint: DO), you can save yourself a lot of effort by using the validation functions in Puppet Labs' `stdlib` module. We ship a version of `stdlib` with PE 2.0, and you can also download it for free at either [GitHub][stdgit] or [the module forge][stdforge]. The functions are:

- `validate_array`
- `validate_bool`
- `validate_hash`
- `validate_re`
- `validate_string`

You can learn how to use these by running `puppet doc --reference function | less` on a system that has `stdlib` installed in its `modulepath`, or you can read the documentation directly in each of the functions' files --- look in the `lib/puppet/parser/functions` directory of the module.

**Next Lesson:**

There's more to say about modules --- we still haven't covered data separation, patterns for making your modules more readable, or module composition yet --- but there's more important business afoot. [Continue reading](./agentprep.html) to prepare your VMs (yes, plural) for agent/master Puppet.

**Off-Road:**

We've seen several Apache examples already, and it's pretty likely that you're running at least one web server in your own infrastructure. Why not use one of the off-the-shelf modules available, and see whether you can reproduce your own configuration in an automated way?

[Download Puppet Enterprise for free][dl], and follow [the quick start guide][quick] to get a small environment installed on some test machines. Then, install one of the following modules:

* [puppetlabs/apache](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apache)
* [simondean/iis](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/simondean/iis) (for IIS on Windows Server)
* [Any of the many Nginx modules](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/modules?utf-8=%E2%9C%93&q=nginx&LeadSource=Web+-+Organic&Lead_Source_Description__c=google+-+%28not+provided%29&utm_source__c=google&utm_medium__c=organic&utm_term__c=%28not+provided%29&utm_content__c=null&utm_campaign__c=%28organic%29&utm_adgroup__c=null&gclid=)

Read the module's documentation to see how it works, then try managing the service and any relevant virtual hosts to match your manually configured infrastructure.
